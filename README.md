# ep0ch-door

A BBS door into a pi-herdr-outliner outline: it reads everything, edits notes in place, and comments on them. It talks
straight to the outliner service's Unix socket (protocol 80 or newer) and is not part of the outliner.

The screens are ep0ch's own 1997 art by shypht, read in place from the WOE art packs:
the logon (`SHY-LOGI.ANS`), the main menu (`SHY-EMNU.ANS`, whose twelve "Menu Cmd"
slots now hold live commands), and the bulletin (`SHY-EPO!.ANS`).

## Run

    bun install
    bun src/main.ts                 # default socket: ~/.local/state/pi-herdr-outliner/float-box.sock
    bun src/main.ts /path/to/outliner.sock

| Env | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `EP0CH_SOCKET` | socket path (same as the argument) |
| `EP0CH_PACKS` | folder holding the `woe*.zip` packs (default `/opt/float/bbs/inbox/evan`) |
| `EP0CH_KITTY` | `1` / `0` forces graphics on or off |
| `EP0CH_OBSERVE` | `0` skips registering as an observer (then the door is not in Who's Online and gets no live events) |

## The desk

`D` on the menu, or `bun src/main.ts --desk` to skip the logon. The door owns the whole canvas:
a tiling tree of panes it draws itself, so no multiplexer is needed for layout.

| Pane | What it shows |
|---|---|
| outline | the tree; `←/→` fold, `⏎` read; reveals where a jumped-to block lives |
| reader | the current block; follows the selection unless pinned (`p`); `[ ]` pick a link, `⏎` follow, `u` parent |
| thread | the current block's children as replies, and its comment threads with quoted passages |
| last callers · live | `activity.recent`, refreshed on outline events |
| who's online | `clients.list`, with what each client is reading |
| bulletin | ep0ch art scaled into the pane (Kitty), `, .` for the next piece |

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`, `1`–`9`, click | focus |
| `Ctrl+W` then `h j k l` | focus by direction |
| `Ctrl+W` then `H J K L` | dock the pane along that whole edge |
| `Ctrl+W` then `< > + -`, `=` | resize, even out |
| `Ctrl+W` then `z` / `x` / `s` | zoom, close, swap with next |
| `Ctrl+W` then `o` + `t r h a w b` | add outline / reader / thread / activity / who / bulletin |
| drag a border | resize |
| `/` | floating search with preview |
| `q` / `Esc` | back to the menu |

The layout is saved to `~/.local/state/ep0ch-door/desk.json`. Mouse reporting is on, so use your
terminal's selection modifier (Shift in Ghostty) to select text.

## The board

`K` on the menu, or `bun src/main.ts [--ws <workspace root>] --board [hub-block-id]`. Any block with two or more
virtual-branch children is a board; `g` picks one (Delivery Flow on the pi-outliner outline, Outbox on float-hub).
The last board per workspace is remembered.

`--ws ~/float-hub` finds that workspace's socket the way the outliner does
(`~/.local/state/pi-herdr-outliner/<sha256(root)[0:12]>/outliner.sock`).

- **Lanes** are read the way Tree and `pie view` read saved views (`src/views.ts`, ported from the outliner's
  `saved-view-read.ts`): the query is parsed into property filters, views without a sort use the service's
  branch-local rank order (`rankViewId`), roots are kept once, the authored limit (default 200) applies, and
  a lane says `of N+` when truncated or `invalid` / `failed` with the reason instead of looking empty.
  Checked identical against the outliner's own evaluator: all 8 branches on float-hub and all 34 on the pi-outliner outline.
- **One preview** follows the selected card. **⏎** opens into the detail; **alt+⏎** opens a second detail.
- **`c`** collapses a lane to a spine (click or ⏎ it to reopen; `C` reopens all).
- **Resize** by dragging any border: between lanes, between preview and details, lanes/readers, drawer edges.
  Keys: `{ }` lane height, `< >` width of the focused lane or reader.
- **`o`** pops the focused reader out as a floating pane: drag its title to move, drag `◢` to resize, `H J K L`
  to nudge, `o` again to dock it back as a detail, `x` to close.
- **`t`** outline drawer with its own mini preview underneath; slides over unless pinned (`T`); `S` moves it
  to the other side so it doesn't cover the preview.
- **`b`** backlinks drawer spanning all readers, with its own preview of the selected source and the quoted
  snippet; `B` pins it; ⏎ / alt+⏎ opens a source in a detail.
- Layout, pins, collapsed lanes and drawer side are saved to `delivery.json`.

## Moving cards

A lane's query is a list of property clauses that must all hold, so a card moves by patching the
properties the target lane names. Nothing else on the card changes.

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `H` / `L` | move the selected card into the lane to the left / right |
| `m` | move picker: every lane with what moving there would patch, or why it can't |
| drag a card onto a lane | the same; while dragging, the lane and the hint line say what the drop would do |

- **Only what differs is patched.** Clauses the card already satisfies are left alone. A value the
  card has is replaced in place; a missing one is appended to its metadata. Values compare
  case-insensitively, like the outliner.
- **Refused, with the reason and no write:**
  - invalid lanes: `not`, `or` and `and` aren't in the query grammar, nor are `-key` or `key:value`;
    lanes with no `query::` (sort-only, limit-only) are invalid too
  - a bare word or `key` clause the card lacks: it asks for any value, and a move can't pick one
  - two values for one key (`stage=a stage=b`)
  - a card with two values for the key being changed: the door won't guess which one moves
  - a lane that's still loading or failed to read
- **Revision checks.** The move names the revision the board showed the card at. The door asks the
  service for the card's property tokens (their `ordinal`s, at that revision) instead of re-parsing
  the text, then sends one `properties.patch`. If anyone changed the card since the board loaded, it
  isn't moved: the lanes reload and the card stays where it was.
- **Open edits.** A card open as a draft isn't moved; save or close the edit first. Moving never
  replaces text under an edit, and a draft whose card another client moved is refused on save.
- After a move the lanes reload, the card is selected in its new lane, and the flash names the patch
  (`moved to Review · stage queued -> review · track + door`), plus any other lane it still matches.
  A collapsed target lane reopens.

## Editing notes

Any reader edits the note it shows: the board's preview, details and floats, and the desk's reader.
On a board lane, `e` edits the selected card in the preview. The river stays read-only.

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `e` | edit in place; the draft is the note's whole text: subject line, body and `[key::value]` properties |
| `Ctrl+E` | hand the draft to `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` (then `vi`); what comes back replaces the draft |
| `Ctrl+S` | save |
| `Ctrl+R` | after the note changed elsewhere: load the current text (your draft is copied to disk first) |
| `Esc` | close; with unsaved changes it asks for a second `Esc` |

- **Saving** sends `update` with the revision the draft started from. The service refuses it if anyone
  else saved since, and the door never retries it over their text: the draft stays open, is copied to
  `~/.local/state/ep0ch-door/drafts/`, and `Ctrl+R` starts over from the current revision.
- **While a draft is open** the reader stays on its note, takes every key (board and window shortcuts
  included), and marks "changed elsewhere" when an outline event says the note moved on, instead of
  replacing what you typed. `Ctrl+C` asks twice when an edit is unsaved.
- **Properties:** the service decides which `[key::value]` tokens are properties (one followed by more
  text on its line is plain text). When the service offers `properties.preview` (pi-herdr-outliner
  PIE-401), the first `Ctrl+S` on a draft that would change them says which and writes nothing; `Ctrl+S`
  again saves. Older services save at once, and the reader then says which properties changed.
- **Attribution:** door edits are recorded as `author: user`, `actorId: ep0ch-door`, like the
  outliner's own Detail.
- `peek` reports open drafts under `editing` (dirty, changed elsewhere, refused, where the copy went).

## Commenting

The same readers comment on the note they show. On the board, Tab to the preview (or a detail) first:
`c` on a lane still collapses it.

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `c` | pick a passage to quote; the reader switches to the note's source text with the passage highlighted |
| `j k` | move to the next / previous line with text (the whole line, without its indent) |
| `J K` | extend / shrink the passage by a line |
| `h l`, `H L` | move where the quote starts (`h l`) or ends (`H L`) by a word |
| `Enter` | write the comment under the quote; `Ctrl+S` sends, `Ctrl+E` hands it to `$EDITOR` |
| `m` | the note's comment threads: `j k` pick, `r` reply, `x` resolve or reopen, `c` a new comment |
| `Esc` | back a step; with unsent text it asks for a second `Esc` |

- **Why the source text:** the service anchors a comment on an exact quote of the stored text. The
  rendered view restyles and drops text (properties, markup, checklist ids), so a quote picked there
  could fail to match. Lines that already carry comments have a `▐` in the gutter.
- **Sending** is `annotations.batch` with a `block-comment` operation: the note's revision, the exact
  quote and its offset. The service refuses it if the note changed since you picked the passage, or the
  quote isn't where the offset says. Nothing is written then; the comment stays open, and `Ctrl+R` finds
  the same words in the current text (nearest the old place) or, if they are gone, goes back to picking
  with your text kept.
- **Retries can't duplicate.** Every comment and reply carries a `requestId`, made once per comment and
  reused when you send the same text again. If the answer is lost (timeout, dropped socket), `Ctrl+S`
  again gets back the comment the service already saved. If you change the text after a lost answer,
  the door says it could become a second comment and waits for another `Ctrl+S`.
- **Resolve / reopen** is `annotations.lifecycle`. It sets a state, so repeating it is harmless.
- **While commenting** the reader stays on its note and takes every key. `Ctrl+C` and closing the
  screen ask twice when a comment is unsent, and copy it to `drafts/` if you go ahead.
- **Attribution:** comments and replies are `author: user`, like the outliner's own Detail (the service
  takes an actor id only on agent comments). Resolve and reopen record `actorId: ep0ch-door`.
- The reader's header counts open comments; the desk's thread pane lists them and refreshes on outline events.

## Reading notes

Every reader (board, desk) renders bodies with `src/doc.ts`:

- **Images and video.** A line that is only `img:: path`, `[img::path]` or `[video::path]` becomes an inline image
  through Kitty. Big images are shrunk with `sips`, video gets a poster frame from `ffmpeg` (or Quick Look), cached in
  `~/.cache/ep0ch-door/media`. `\ ` escapes and macOS screenshot names (narrow no-break space before AM/PM) resolve.
  `[ ]` selects an image like a link and ⏎ opens it in the system viewer. Images a drawer or float covers are hidden.
  If macOS blocks the read (Desktop, Documents), the line says so: grant the terminal Files & Folders access.
- **Callouts.** `> [!note] Title` (tip, warning, danger, summary, example, question, quote, …) render as colored boxes;
  `[!x]-` starts folded, `z` unfolds.
- **Tables.** Markdown tables render as real tables: columns sized to fit, long cells wrap onto more lines.
- **mdxcn figures** ([mdxcn.dev](https://mdxcn.dev)): `::graph-*` Comark blocks with YAML props draw natively in
  a dotted `+ ··· [ TITLE ] ··· +` frame: check, timeline, stat, kpi, rank, funnel, waterfall, spark, plot, meter,
  gantt, tree, table (`src/graphs.ts`). The official fenced ASCII an agent pastes (`+--- [ TITLE ] ---+`) is re-framed
  the same way. Unknown kinds say so inside the frame.
- **Live figures** (`src/live.ts`): give a figure `query: "type=outbox-item ticket=PC-762"` or `view: ((block-ref))`
  instead of values, and the door answers it from the outline on every render, re-asking when the outline changes.
  The note stores the question, so status lives in one place. Footer reads `live · N results`.
  - `check`: `done: "outbox=done"` ticks rows, `note: waiting-on` adds a property line
  - `stat`/`kpi`: each item takes its own `query`/`view`; the value is a live count
  - `rank`: `group: ticket` counts per value · `table`: `columns: [ticket, title, waiting-on, updated]`
  - `timeline`: dated by `updated`/`created` or `date: <property>`, `now: "<filter>"` · `meter`: share matching `done`
  - `view:` reads a saved virtual branch the faithful way (ranks, limit, errors); `query:` is an explicit filter.
- Long callout titles keep a short head on the border and flow the rest into the box.
- Code fences, headings, lists, blockquotes, `**bold**`, `[[links]]`, `((refs))` and `[key::value]` are styled.

## The river

`Q` on the menu, or `bun src/main.ts --river`. Quay's model (built with Grok from an outline export, in
`~/projects/tundra-heart-crane-lotus`) on the live outline instead of a seed file:

- **Placement (niri):** `⏎` inserts a column right after its source, or jumps to it if that note is already a column. `alt+⏎` forces a duplicate.
- **Compression (Andy's notes):** columns get full, peek or spine width by distance from focus; docked (`p`) columns resist. Spine titles are rotated VGA text (Kitty) or stacked letters (cells).
- **Threads (Twitter):** `space` expands replies in place under a rail; `s` splits a note into a stacked pane in the same column; `tab` moves between stacked panes.
- **Per-pane filters:** `f`, then `type:hub -status:done author:codex word`.
- **Virtual branches:** `#` lists the note's properties; pick one for a column of every note sharing it.
- **Jump:** `/` searches the whole outline index locally, with no round trip per keystroke.
- **Quote** needs write access, so it's not here.

Reply counts, titles and the jump palette come from one `tree.index` call (about 1.4 MB for 1.5k blocks,
cached in `river-index.json` and refreshed in the background on its own connection). Card bodies come
from `children`. The layout is saved to `river.json`.

## What maps to what

| BBS | Outline |
|---|---|
| New scan | blocks updated since your last logoff (`~/.local/state/ep0ch-door/lastcall.json`) |
| Join conference | top-level blocks |
| Message reader | a block: author, date, breadcrumb, properties, body; `T` its children, `U` its parent |
| Who's online | `clients.list`: every Tree, Detail, agent, and this door |
| Last callers | `activity.recent` across user, agent and system edits |
| File areas | the WOE zips, with each pack's `FILE_ID.DIZ` as its description |
| Stats | 7×24 heatmap of when messages were written, and top posters |

## Graphics

Kitty graphics are used only where cells can't do it, and every word stays real terminal text:

- **Art** is rasterized with the 9×16 VGA font from `../ep0ch/ep0ch.html` and placed under the text layer.
  Menu and logon art are placed one art cell per terminal cell, so live text lands exactly in the art's slots.
  The viewer keeps true VGA proportions.
- **CRT**: scanlines and a phosphor bloom at the lowest Kitty layer, so they show through default-background cells only.
- **Heatmap** in Stats is pixels.
- Each distinct image is uploaded once (raw RGBA, zlib-compressed). Reveal and scroll only change the placement's
  source rectangle. Placements are diffed per frame; exit frees all image data.

`V` cycles Kitty+CRT → Kitty → cells. Under Herdr, graphics follow `[terminal] kitty_graphics` in
`~/.config/herdr/config.toml` (older builds: `[experimental]`), because Herdr panes report `xterm-256color`.

## Letting an agent see what you see

A running door listens on `~/.local/state/ep0ch-door/door.sock` (a second door uses `door-<pid>.sock`):

    bun src/main.ts peek              # screen as text + structured state: board, lanes, selection, which block each reader shows
    bun src/main.ts snap [out.png]    # PNG of exactly what the terminal was sent, images included
    bun src/main.ts open <block-id>   # put a block in front of the user (board: the detail; desk: the reader; river: a column)

`snap` comes from a mirror that receives every byte written to the terminal (`src/mirror.ts`, the same
compositor the snapshot harness uses), so it shows what is actually on screen, not a re-render.
`open` flashes "an agent opened: …" so it's never silent.

## What the door sends

Reads: `ping`, `children`, `blocks.context`, `blocks.query`, `tree.index`, `references.backlinks`,
`annotations.list`, `clients.list`, `activity.recent`, plus `events.subscribe` as an `observer`, which
puts the door in `clients.list` until it exits.

Writes, only on an explicit key:

- `update` when you save an edit, with `expectedRevision`, attributed `author: user`, `actorId: ep0ch-door`.
- `properties.patch` when you move a card between lanes, with `expectedRevision`, attributed the same way.
- `annotations.batch` (one `block-comment` operation) when you send a comment: `expectedRevision`, the
  exact quote and its offset, and a `requestId`.
- `annotations.reply` when you send a reply, with a `requestId`.
- `annotations.lifecycle` when you resolve or reopen a thread.

The service has no auth or read-only mode, so these limits are the door's own discipline.

## Checking it

    bun test
    bun run check
    bun scripts/snap.ts           # drives the real door against the live outline and writes out/snap-kitty-*.png
    bun scripts/snap.ts cells     # same, cells mode
    bun scripts/snap.ts desk      # the desk at 200×60: expand, focus, add a pane, dock, search
    bun scripts/snap.ts river     # the river at 200×60: open beside, replies, compression, jump
    bun scripts/render.ts SHY-EMNU.ANS   # one piece to out/*.png
    EP0CH_SOCKET=<scratch sock> EP0CH_SNAP_WRITES=1 bun scripts/snap.ts edit   # seeds a board, edits, races a second writer
    EP0CH_SOCKET=<scratch sock> EP0CH_SNAP_WRITES=1 bun scripts/snap.ts move   # seeds a board, moves by key, picker and drag, a refusal, a stale card
    EP0CH_SOCKET=<scratch sock> EP0CH_SNAP_WRITES=1 bun scripts/snap.ts comment   # quotes, comments, replies, resolves, races a second writer

`test/edit.test.ts`, `test/move.test.ts` and `test/comment.test.ts` save, move, comment and race real
writes against a throwaway outliner service they start themselves (own state dir and workspace, Inbox
agents off). `test/move.test.ts` also checks the door's query parser against the outliner's
`block-query.ts`, and every lane after the moves against the outliner's own `saved-view-read.ts`. Point
`EP0CH_OUTLINER` at a pi-herdr-outliner checkout (default `../pi-herdr-outliner`); without one those tests
skip. The `edit`, `move` and `comment` snapshots write too, so they refuse to run unless
`EP0CH_SNAP_WRITES=1`: never point them at a real outline.

`scripts/snap.ts` runs a small emulator over the exact bytes the door writes (cursor moves, colour,
Kitty upload, place, crop and delete) and composites them into a PNG.

## Known limits

- The forwarded socket moves about 150 KB/s; 400 full blocks take roughly 8 s. Lists show 40 first and stream the rest.
- The editor counts one cell per character, so wide (CJK, some emoji) characters misplace the cursor.
- The Herdr capability check reads a config file; a lasting version should ask Herdr.
